# Engineering for the Age of AI

We help businesses bridge the gap between **hyper-scale distributed systems** and **rapid, AI-native product development**. 

In a world where technology evolves weekly, you don't just need a developer. You need a partner who has built systems for **200 million users** and launched AI products **from zero to store** in weeks.

## I. Performance is a Feature

Modern users have zero patience for latency. We bring the architectural discipline of top-tier tech giants to your infrastructure.

### The Scale Story: Optimizing TikTok
At **ByteDance (TikTok)**, we tackled one of the world's most demanding engineering challenges: the Discovery Page API. 

*   **The Problem:** Serving 200M+ Daily Active Users (DAU) with a legacy Python architecture that was hitting a latency wall (800ms+).
*   **The Solution:** We led the migration to a high-concurrency **Go** architecture, introducing parallel RPC pipelines and a robust fallback caching layer.
*   **The Result:** 
    *   Latency slashed from **839ms** to **187ms**.
    *   Error rates reduced from **1.3%** to **0.0004%**.

### The Infrastructure Story: Custom Innovation
Standard tools don't always fit. At **Appcoach**, when off-the-shelf Kafka clients became a bottleneck for our real-time bidding network, we didn't just complain. We built **SEJ**, a custom distributed message queue, achieving **2,000+ QPS per core** with **sub-10ms** latency. 

**We don't just use the cloud. We engineer it.**

## II. Solving the Hard Problems

Not every problem is a CRUD app. We thrive in the deep end of engineering—where heavy mathematics, complex domains, and strict reliability meet.

### The Complexity Story: Maritime Intelligence
At **90poe**, we architected global weather services processing **2TB of data annually**. This wasn't simple data movement; it required implementing strict **spherical geometry algorithms** for vessel voyage estimation and rhumb line tracking. 

### The Precision Story: Compiler Design
At **IBM/SPSS**, we fixed a critical, long-standing logic flaw in an enterprise visual filter editor. How? By ripping out a fragile Regular Expression system and writing a robust **Recursive Descent Parser** from scratch. 

**We solve root causes, not just symptoms.**

## III. Rapid Delivery in New Domains

The most valuable skill in the AI age is **adaptability**. We combine deep engineering roots with modern AI tools to master new stacks instantly.

### The Agile Story: AI-Native Development
We believe the future of coding is **human intent amplified by AI**. To prove it, we went from zero knowledge of the Apple ecosystem to shipping two featured iOS apps—**WatchLess** and **TempoBlocks**—in record time.

We leverage AI to handle the "how" (syntax, boilerplate, libraries) so we can focus entirely on the "what" (Product Value, User Experience, Architecture).

### The Modern Web Story: Privacy & Performance
At **Venatus**, we architected complex header-bidding solutions using **TypeScript** while navigating strict TCF v2.2 privacy laws. We proved that you can respect user privacy without sacrificing ad revenue or page performance.

**We don't just know the stack. We master the stack you need, when you need it.**
