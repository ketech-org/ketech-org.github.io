**Effective date:** 4 December 2025  
**Company:** K&E Technology Consultants Ltd ("K&E", "we", "us", "our")  
**Contact:** info@ketech.org

These Terms govern your use of our iOS applications and any related services we make available (collectively, the "Apps"). By downloading, accessing, or using an App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Apps.

---

## 1. Who These Terms Apply To

The Apps are intended for a general audience, including both children and adults. If you are under the age of legal majority where you live, you may use the Apps only with permission of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms.

---

## 2. License to Use the Apps

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, K&E grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the Apps for your personal, non-commercial use on an Apple device that you own or control, in accordance with Apple’s Media Services Terms and Conditions and App Store rules.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

---

## 3. Ads and Third-Party Content

The Apps may display advertisements, including ads provided by third-party networks such as Google or other major providers. Ads may be contextual or general in nature.

We do not control third-party ads or sites that may be linked from ads. If you click on a third-party ad or link, you do so at your own risk and subject to that third party’s terms and policies. K&E is not responsible for third-party content, products, or services.

---

## 4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

Some Apps offer optional in-app purchases, including auto-renewing subscriptions.

**Billing & renewal**

- Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.
- Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

**Managing subscriptions**
You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings after purchase.

**No refunds by K&E**
Apple handles all billing and refunds. K&E cannot issue refunds directly. Refund requests must be made through Apple.

**Changes**
We may change subscription offerings (pricing, features, or availability) to the extent permitted by Apple’s rules and applicable law. Any changes will apply to future periods unless otherwise required.

---

## 5. No Account Registration / Minimal Data Handling

The Apps do not require account registration and are designed not to collect personally identifiable user information directly.

However, **third-party services** used in the Apps (such as ad networks or Apple’s purchase systems) may collect limited data necessary to provide their services (for example, showing ads or processing purchases). Their data handling is governed by their own policies.

Please review our Privacy Policy (if provided alongside the App or on our website) for more detail.

---

## 6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Apps in any unlawful, harmful, or abusive way.
- Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the Apps (including hacking, introducing malware, or bypassing security).
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the Apps, except where such restriction is prohibited by law.
- Use the Apps to infringe any person’s rights.

We may suspend or terminate access to an App if you violate these Terms.

---

## 7. Intellectual Property

The Apps, including all content, software, designs, logos, and trademarks, are owned by or licensed to K&E and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, or create derivative works from any part of the Apps unless we give you written permission.

---

## 8. App Updates and Availability

We may update or modify the Apps at any time, including adding, removing, or changing features. We do not guarantee that any App, feature, or content will always be available.

We may stop supporting or distributing an App at any time.

---

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Apps are provided **"as is"** and **"as available."**  
K&E disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that:

- the Apps will be uninterrupted or error-free,
- the Apps will meet your requirements, or
- defects will be corrected.

---

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- K&E will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from or related to your use of the Apps.
- K&E’s total liability for any claim arising out of or related to the Apps will not exceed the amount you paid to K&E for the App or in-app purchase in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim (or **£10** if you paid nothing).

Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be excluded under law (such as liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or fraud).

---

## 11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless K&E from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the Apps or violation of these Terms.

---

## 12. Children and Parental Guidance

Because the Apps are intended for both children and adults:

- Parents/guardians should supervise children’s use and help them understand safe device and purchasing practices.
- In-App purchases are optional and can be restricted using Apple’s Screen Time / parental controls.

---

## 13. Apple-Specific Terms

These Terms are between you and K&E, not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the Apps or their content.

To the extent permitted by law, Apple has no warranty obligations for the Apps, and Apple is not responsible for addressing claims relating to the Apps, including:

- product liability claims,
- claims that the App fails to conform to legal or regulatory requirements, or
- claims arising under consumer protection or similar laws.

If a third party claims that an App infringes their intellectual property rights, K&E—not Apple—will be responsible for investigating, defending, settling, and discharging such claims.

---

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of **England and Wales**, without regard to conflict of law principles.  
Courts located in England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the Apps, except where consumer protection laws require otherwise.

---

## 15. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective date" above and, where practical, provide notice within the App or on our website.

Your continued use of the Apps after changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.
