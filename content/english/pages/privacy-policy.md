**Effective date:** 4 December 2025  
**Company:** K&E Technology Consultants Ltd (“we”, “us”, “our”)  
**Contact email:** info@ketech.org

This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS apps (the "Apps") handle information when you use them. We aim to keep this clear and simple.

## 1. Summary

- We do **not** require account registration.
- We do **not** ask for your name, email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information.
- The Apps may show **ads** and offer **in-app purchases / subscriptions**.
- Some data may be collected automatically by Apple, our ad providers, and related service partners to make ads work, process purchases, prevent fraud, and measure performance.
- The Apps are intended for **both children and adults**, and we take extra care with child safety and ad settings.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information you provide to us

**None.**  
We don’t provide sign-ups, profiles, or user-to-user features, so you do not directly provide personal information to us.

### 2.2 Information collected automatically

Although we don’t collect personal info directly, the Apps and integrated services may automatically collect certain data, such as:

- **Device and app information**: device type, operating system version, language, app version, and performance diagnostics (e.g., crash logs).
- **Approximate location**: inferred from IP address (city/region-level), if enabled by an ad provider.
- **Advertising identifiers**: such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) or other device identifiers, when you grant permission.
- **Usage data**: how you interact with the Apps (e.g., screens viewed, session duration).

This data is typically used for **ad delivery, ad measurement, analytics, fraud prevention, and product improvement**.

## 3. Advertising

Our Apps display ads delivered by third-party ad networks (for example, Google AdMob or similar providers). These partners may collect and process device identifiers, IP address, approximate location, and usage data to:

- show ads in the Apps,
- limit ad frequency,
- measure ad performance,
- detect fraud and abuse.

If an App is used by children, we aim to use child-appropriate ad settings (e.g., non-personalised or families-compliant ads where supported). Ad networks require this for child-directed audiences.

**Your choices:**

- You can control ad tracking permissions in **iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking**.
- If you decline tracking, ads may still appear but may be less relevant.

## 4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

We offer optional in-app purchases and subscriptions through Apple’s In-App Purchase system. When you buy a subscription:

- **Apple processes your payment** and handles your payment information.
- We receive **transaction/receipt information** (e.g., purchase status, product type) to unlock features.
- We do **not** receive your full payment card details.

Apple's processing is governed by Apple's own privacy practices.

## 5. How We Use Information

We (and our service partners) use information to:

1. **Deliver app functionality** and maintain performance.
2. **Show ads** and measure their effectiveness.
3. **Process purchases** and subscription entitlements.
4. **Prevent fraud, security issues, and abuse.**
5. **Improve the Apps** (for example, by understanding crashes or common feature usage).

We only use data for purposes consistent with this policy.

## 6. Legal Bases (UK GDPR)

Where UK GDPR applies, we rely on:

- **Legitimate interests**: to operate, secure, and improve the Apps, and to fund them using ads.
- **Consent**: where required for tracking-based advertising or similar technologies.
- **Contract**: to provide paid features you purchase.

## 7. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share limited data with:

- **Ad providers** (to serve/measure ads),
- **Apple** (for purchases and device services),
- **Analytics / crash reporting providers** (if used),
- **Law enforcement or regulators** if required by law.

These partners process data under their own privacy policies and contractual obligations.

## 8. International Transfers

Some partners (like major ad networks) may process data outside the UK. When this happens, they are expected to use appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent protections).

## 9. Data Retention

Because we don't maintain user accounts, we keep **no user profiles** on our servers.  
Third-party partners retain data for their own operational needs, following their retention policies. We encourage reviewing their notices for details.

## 10. Children's Privacy

Our Apps may be used by children. We:

- do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children,
- do not require accounts or user submissions,
- aim to use child-appropriate ad configurations where applicable.

If you are a parent/guardian and believe your child's information has been processed in a way that concerns you, contact us at **info@ketech.org** and we will help.

## 11. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- access data,
- request deletion,
- object to processing,
- withdraw consent (where consent is the basis).

Because we do not store identifying user data, we may not be able to link requests to a specific person. You can also manage many privacy choices directly through iOS settings.

## 12. Security

We use reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect the Apps and minimize data collection. No system is perfectly secure, but we work to prevent misuse or unauthorized access.

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy if our Apps or legal requirements change.  
We will post the updated version on our website and/or app listing with a new effective date.
